### Why?

Ticki started their blog post talking about how they've been working on Open Source projects for a number of years. Eventually, they got really invested in creating projects in Rust. They had a number of reasons for leaving. 



The first of which was a lack of time. They no longer had time to dedicate anymore because they're putting everything into pursuing their career aspirations. 

> My main reason is that I have chosen to pursue a career in mathematics research. This is an extremely tough field and with this decision, I have no way of continuing my involvement in these very time consuming projects. I do not have even a hour to spend a week. And it is simply unrealistic to think that the situation will get any better; I will continue to put all my time and energy into this path.

The second of which was a difference in what direction they wanted the project to move in, versus what the core team wanted to do. Bringing up how they wanted to pursue these really interesting theoretical proposals, was what they wanted to do. However, the core team knew the feasibility of these proposals, and it became a bit of a problem for Ticki.
