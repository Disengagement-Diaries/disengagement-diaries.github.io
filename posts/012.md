### Who?

**Github:** [Dmitry Shachnev](https://github.com/mitya57) and [Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer](https://github.com/perezmeyer)

**Project:** [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)

**Ecosystem:** [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

### Why?

Both of these maintainers quit for the same reasons outlined in this [blog post](https://perezmeyer.blogspot.com/2020/08/stepping-down-as-qt-6-maintainers.html). They didn't go into much about the specifics, but the two reasons why they left were lack of time, and a lack of support (not enough build power.)

> We ***\*love\**** Qt, but it's a huge codebase and requires time and  build power, both things that we are currently lacking, so we decided  it's time for us to step down and pass the torch. And a new major  version seems the right point to do that.
