### Who?

**Github:** [Antonio Uccio Verardi](https://github.com/flavray/avro-rs/issues/174)

**Project:** [avro-rs](https://github.com/flavray/avro-rs)

### Why?

This contributor [announced](https://github.com/flavray/avro-rs/issues/174) they were taking an indefinite break from maintaining the project (avro-rs.) Citing that they don't have as much time to dedicate to open source, and that they'd rather spend the time contributing to projects they're using. 

> I have decided to take an indefinite break from maintaining this  library. I don't have much free time to dedicate to open-source these  days and I think it would be better spent contributing to the projects I use and like instead of being a pretty absent maintainer.
