### Who?

**Github:** [ossanna16](https://github.com/ossanna16)

**Project:** [Django](https://github.com/django/django)

**Date:** December 2018

### Why?

Ossowski cited three reasons for leaving her open source communities at DjangoCon US in 2018. These reasons arose because she had to change her priorities as new events unfolded in her life. The first issue was the lack of a work life balance as newer, more important responsibilities arose.

> "People's living situations change or your priorities change and so people may say after a while I can't do it anymore for whatever reason." (15:44)
>
> "Tech kind of takes over our whole life. I'm definitely guilty of that so I'm kind of like actively saying no." (30:00)

This led to a lack of time internally due to her shift in priorities. Although she still appreciated the Django community, she found contributing to open source to take away from more significant priorities, like a new job and changing living situtations.

> "I'm actually moving cities so I also kind of want to prioritize my personal life a little more I've served the community a lot and now it's kind of like time to look after myself a little more I'm out I also took on this PSF thing which is a huge job and so I needed to get rid of something else on my plate." (17:06)

Finally, she felt it was the right time to quit since the spark that originally led her to contribute to open source software was no longer there.

> "There were it's just a feeling that told me it's time to pass it onto someone else so if you feel like you're not totally enjoying yourself anymore I think that's a good time to quit." (17:28)

### Interventions

Ossowski recommends establishing a good work life balance between tech and one's personal life, choosing people one enjoys working with, and not being afraid to ask other people be they users or contributors. She believed she experienced burnout because she was dedicating too much of her time towards work and open source projects which caused her to feel overwhelmed despite liking her open source communities. Her main highlight from her time in open source were the people, which encouraged her to continue. Furthermore, she found the support from her community to be one of the most significant factors that helped postpone her disengagemnt from open source.
