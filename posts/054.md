### Who?

**Github:** [freakboy3742](https://github.com/freakboy3742)

**Project:** [Django](https://github.com/django/django)

### Why?

Keith-Magee cited multiple reasons which led him and his peers to disengage from open source projects. The first reasons was a lack of support from his peers, which led to Keith-Magee taking on more responsibilties than he would've liked and deciding the Django community wasn't the kind of community he wanted to be a part of.

> "Nobody was enthusiastic enough to volunteer their time to address some gap or make the most of some opportunity." (51:17)

He believed his peers had other priorities in life and not enough time to dedicate to open source projects.

> "They had other life commitments or couldn't justify donating all their spare time to a volunteer effort." (51:27)

Although he fully understood their reasons, it still made his work more difficult as a maintainer at the time. He faced issues with the community policy, more specifically the code of conduct (59:37). This caused extreme burnout which, along with other developments in his life, led him to suffer from depression.

>  "I was diagnosed as being in the middle of a major depressive episode and there were a number of contributing factors but one of the big ones was the pressures imposed by my volunteer work dealing with the Django community." (59:23)
