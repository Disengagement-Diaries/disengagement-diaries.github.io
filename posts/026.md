### Who?

**Github:** [Myron Marston](https://github.com/myronmarston)

**Project:** [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)

### Why?

One of the RSpec project leads, Myron Marston [announced](https://rspec.info/blog/2018/09/jon-rowe-and-sam-phippen-are-rspecs-new-leads/) that he was leaving the project. He brought up how since his first contribution (to Spec) eight years ago, a lot of things have happened. Some of which have resulted in him moving further and further away from the project. One of his jobs switched languages from Ruby, and later on his other job used Java.

> I changed employers from Moz to Square last year
> I stopped using Ruby as my primary language about 3 years ago (at Moz we switched to Elixir and my team at Square is using Java)

Plus, he mentioned that he has children now! 

> I have 3 kids now (when I started working on RSpec I didn't have any!)
>
> I no longer have the kind of time I used to to work on open source

Later on he mentions that he often isn't enjoying working on the project anymore either when he as the time, and he's not really using the project as well.

> As much as I have enjoyed working on RSpec for the better part of a decade, I rarely have the time anymore, and when I do have the time, I often don't enjoy it. I'm also no longer a regular user of RSpec.
