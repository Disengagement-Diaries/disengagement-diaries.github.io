### Who?

**Github:** [Vitaly Slobodin](https://github.com/vitallium)

**Project:** [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)

### Why?

Google Chrome had announced that a headless version of itself was coming, and unfortunately prompted PhantomJS maintainer, Vitaly Slobodin, to announce that he was stepping down. He believed that Chrome is faster, more stable and now with headless support there was no way PhantomJS could compete anymore. 

> I think people will switch to it, eventually. Chrome is faster and  more stable than PhantomJS. And it doesn't eat memory like crazy.
>
> I don't see any future in developing PhantomJS.

On top of that, he was struggling to support the project as well.

> Even with recently released 2.5 Beta version with new and shiny  QtWebKit, I can't physically support all 3 platforms at once (I even  bought the Mac for that!). We have no support.
