### Who?

**Github:** [Jean-Baptiste Quéru](https://github.com/jbqueru)

**Project:** [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/)

### Why?

Jean-Baptiste Quéru [announced](https://plus.google.com/u/0/112218872649456413744/posts/9HHRURorE7g) that he was quitting the Android Open Source Project, after the lack of support from Qualcomm (the device manufacturer) who were not providing the factory images and driver binaries for the project. 

> Well, I see that people have figured out why I’m quitting AOSP.
>
> There’s no point being the maintainer of an Operating System that  can’t boot to the home screen on its flagship device for lack of GPU support, especially when I’m getting the blame for something that I  don’t have authority to fix myself and that I had anticipated and  escalated more than 6 months ahead.
