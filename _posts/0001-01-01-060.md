### Who?

**GitHub:** [sarony](https://github.com/sarony)

**Project:** [CodeNewbie](https://github.com/code-newbies)

**Date:** June 2021

### Why?

Saron Yitbarek cited two main reasons that led to her disengagement from open source at PyCon US 2021. She realized she developed depression while working  on open source and continued to struggle mentally.

> "I was feeling really really depressed for four months at a time I didn't know what was going on. I hated everything, I was just very down." (25:06)

This made burnout a common symptom for her, yet it was something she refused to acknowledge.

> "I was afraid of finding out the things I loved about myself, my creativity my passion, my focus wasn't really me." (26:29)

She hoped that her original interest in open source hadn't gone away, especially since she'd spent so much of her time building her own communities, CodeNewbie and Disco. Despite this, her depression and self-doubt eventually made her quit open source. She has had no contributions since May 2020 and appears to still feel like distancing herself from open source as of PyCon 2021.

### Interventions

Saron Yitbarek recommended contributors work at a steady pace in order to manage their health and energy. She believed one of the hardest lessons she had to learn was how to take constructive criticism, which could be easily interpreted the wrong way and lead to quicker burnout. She explained one should take feedback as a form of love since that feedback can help one reach their full potential. She believed viewing criticism in this way is the best mindset to have.
