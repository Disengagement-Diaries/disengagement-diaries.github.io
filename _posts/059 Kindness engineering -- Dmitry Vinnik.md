### Who?

**Github:** [dmitryvinn](https://github.com/dmitryvinn)

**Date:** September 2019

### Why?

Vinnik offers second-hand insight into the reasons for disengagement in open source, specifically involving kindness and clarity on what's going on with one's project. He cites a story from his peer who was bothered while on his vacation.

>"He posted this lovely picture of him enjoying the sun, jumping into the water and then someone made a great comment just that describes the, you know, some of the, not the nicest people. This comment was weird feedback to give to someone who's enjoying vacation but that's something we have to deal with, not very kind comments." (2:08)

Although Vinnik initially refers to this as a "not very kind comment," he later goes on to emphasize how this caused his peer to leave open source completely. This treatment of his fellow contributor led Vinnik to find problems with the project policy such as the code of conduct.

> "There is maybe the code of conduct but there is a lack of understanding and appreciation of how important it is, and that's not going to work well." (6:50)

Additionally, Vinnik sees the lack of project direction as fuel for these other problems. He feels that without a measure of success, everyone is just lost and this sense of hopelessness will lead those in the community to do sometimes questionable and problematic things.

> "And lack of direction is also an important aspect in the area for us to easily burn out because it's hard to measure success of dev rel hence we're going to keep that in mind and try to figure out." (13:29)

### Interventions

Vinnik hopes that everyone can treat each other with kindness both in and out of  open source communities. He reccommends trying to emphasize with one's community especially since he believes most people in open source are hoping to learn. Most of all, he emphasizes the need to see others as more than just "meaningless, faceless avatars" (9:03).
