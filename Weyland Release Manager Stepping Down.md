Following their departure at Samsung Research, which had them working on both Wayland and Weston, Derek Foreman announced that he was stepping down via [email](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2019-April/040389.html) citing that he doesn't have enough time anymore.

> Thanks for the opportunity to help out,
