### Who?

**Github**: [Joey Hess](https://github.com/joeyh)

**Projects:** [debhelper](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/debhelper), [alien](https://packages.debian.org/sid/alien), [dpkg-repack](https://packages.debian.org/sid/dpkg-repack), [debmirror](https://packages.debian.org/sid/debmirror)

**Ecosystem:** [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

### Why?

This long time contributor, who had joined the Debian ecosystem in 1996, finally announced they were leaving in an [email](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/11/msg00174.html) sent to the Debian developers mailing list. Citing the Debian consitution as problematic, they wrote:

> If I have one regret from my 18 years in Debian, it's that when the
> Debian constitution was originally proposed, despite seeing it as
> dubious, I neglected to speak out against it. It's clear to me
> now that it's a toxic document, that has slowly but surely led Debian
> in very unhealthy directions.
